9. Explain the boxing and unboxing concept in .Net?

Boxing: Boxing is a process of converting value type into reference type.
Unboxing: Unboxing is a process of converting reference type to value type.

20. Is it possible to change the index of the primary key on the table? NO

--26. What is the difference between dispose() and finalize()?

Ans:
Dispose - Developer calls 
Finalize - CLR calls automatically 
Although Dispose and Finalize both methods are used by CLR to perform garbage collection of runtime objects of .NET applications but there is a difference between them.

The Finalize method is called automatically by the runtime while the Dispose method is called by the programmer.

Switch-Case : 
multiple If-Else statements. In C#, we should use Switch-Case statements to replace multiple If-Else statements.
