What is SQL?
Structured Query language (SQL) pronounced as "S-Q-L" or sometimes as "See-Quel" is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases. A relational database defines relationships in the form of tables.

SQL programming can be effectively used to insert, search, update, delete database records.

That doesn't mean SQL cannot do things beyond that. It can do a lot of things including, but not limited to, optimizing and maintenance of databases.

Relational databases like MySQL Database, Oracle, Ms SQL Server, Sybase, etc. use SQL.


What is NoSQL?
NoSQL is a non-relational DMS, that does not require a fixed schema, avoids joins, and is easy to scale. NoSQL database is used for distributed data stores with humongous data storage needs. NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example companies like Twitter, Facebook, Google that collect terabytes of user data every single day.

The five critical differences of SQL vs NoSQL:
SQL databases are relational, NoSQL are non-relational or distributed database.
SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores.
SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, NoSQL are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
Example : SQL=>	Oracle, Postgres, and MS-SQL.	
          NoSQL => MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, Cassandra, Hbase.
Best suited for : SQL => An ideal choice for the complex query intensive environment.
                  NoSql :It is not good fit for complex queries.		  
Variations : SQL =>One type with minor variations.	
             NoSQL =>Many different types which include key-value stores, document databases, and graph databases.		

Hierarchical data storage : SQL =>	SQL databases are not suitable for hierarchical data storage.	
             NoSQL =>More suitable for the hierarchical data store as it supports key-value pair method.
			 
			 		
Open-source : SQL =>A mix of open-source like Postgres & MySQL, and commercial like Oracle Database.
             NoSQL => NoSQL DBs are Open-source.	 
			 
Consistency : SQL =>It should be configured for strong consistency.	
             NoSQL =>It depends on DBMS as some offers strong consistency like MongoDB, whereas others offer only eventual consistency, like Cassandra.
			 
Best Used for : SQL => RDBMS database is the right option for solving ACID problems.	
             NoSQL =>NoSQL is a best used for solving data availability problems
			 
Importance : SQL =>	It should be used when data validity is super important	
             NoSQL =>Use when it's more important to have fast data than correct data
			 
Hardware : SQL =>	Specialized DB hardware (Oracle Exadata, etc.)	
             NoSQL =>	Commodity hardware	

ACID vs. BASE Model : SQL =>	ACID( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) is a standard for RDBMS	
             NoSQL =>	Base ( Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually Consistent) is a model of many NoSQL systems


NoSQL : The amount of data stored does not depend on the physical memory of the system. It can be scaled horizontally as per the requirement.

When to use SQL ?
	SQL is the easiest language used to communicate with the RDBMS
	Analyzing behavioral related and customized sessions
	Building custom dashboards
	It allows you to store and gets data from the database quickly
	Preferred when you want to use joins and execute complex queries

When to use NoSQL ?
	When ACID support is not needed
	When Traditional RDBMS model is not enough
	Data which need a flexible schema
	Constraints and validations logic not required to be implemented in database
	Logging data from distributed sources
	It should be used to store temporary data like shopping carts, wish list and session data
