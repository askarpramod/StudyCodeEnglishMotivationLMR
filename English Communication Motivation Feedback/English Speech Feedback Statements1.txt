Sighting the project criticality I'll re-schedule my leave plan, please let me know the updated deadline so that I can plan accordingly.
I suggest to keep some buffer so that we can elude such situation.

- [Announcer] Over the last few months, GPT and ChatGPT have been popular buzzwords, but things kicked off long before in natural language processing.
 A type of AI model architecture called Transformers was proposed by a team of researchers from Google in 2017 in a paper called "Attention is All You Need."
 All large language models use components of Transformers as part of their architecture.

Around 3 months ago, I became a member of LIVN-PPOD. Considering we worked on new technologies; our team quickly learned the ropes and delivered the project on time with great quality. I am grateful to my teammates and leaders, KumarRajeev Ranjan and Ramesh Allu, for their support. It was great being part of this high energy team. There were many challenges we encountered during the project. But Live Nation was easy to reach out to and would help us resolve them quickly. Ultimately project went well, we even received appreciation from them. Many thanks to our client Live Nation.

I joined the Project LIVN-PPOD three months ago, and I am grateful to my teammates and leaders, KumarRajeev Ranjan and Ramesh Allu, for their invaluable support. One of the things that make our team truly exceptional is our ability to work on tight timelines, willingness to help each other at any time and availability for support and guidance. Initially when we started this project, we had lots of challenges and issues, but we overcame all the challenges with teamwork. I am delighted to witness positive feedback and appreciation from our clients. Although the journey was roughly three months, we made good memories and bonding with team, and I cherish every moment spent in the project.
