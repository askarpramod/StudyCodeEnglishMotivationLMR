What is JavaScript Hoisting?
What is JavaScript Closure?
https://www.nickmccullum.com/javascript/understanding-javascript-hoisting-closures/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20we%20discussed%20how%20hoisting,outside%20of%20that%20specific%20function.

JavaScript hoisting is a concept that allows you to refer to JavaScript functions and variables before they have been created.
During this compilation step, JavaScript moves all function and variable declarations to the start of the script. This causes hoisting!
Hoisting also works for variables. However, it only hoists the variable declarations, not the values assigned to the variable.

What is a closure in JavaScript?
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
They allow you to attach variables to an execution context. Variables in closures can help you maintain a state that you can use later. They provide data encapsulation. They help remove redundant code

-- JS Variables 
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp

JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope.
Global variables can be made local (private) with closures.

Note
Variables created without a declaration keyword (var, let, or const) are always global, even if they are created inside a function.
Variable Lifetime
Global variables live until the page is discarded, like when you navigate to another page or close the window.
Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is invoked, and deleted when the function is finished.

A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

#JavaScript #Callbacks : https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_callback.asp
When you pass a function as an argument, remember not to use parenthesis.
===
function myDisplayer(some) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
}

function myCalculator(num1, num2, myCallback) {
  let sum = num1 + num2;
  myCallback(sum);
}

myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);
==

Right: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);
Wrong: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer());

------ #AddTransient
https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/understanding-addtransient-vs-addscoped-vs-addsingleton-in-asp-net-core/
The below three methods define the lifetime of the services,
AddTransient
Transient lifetime services are created each time they are requested. This lifetime works best for lightweight, stateless services.

AddScoped
Scoped lifetime services are created once per request. http 

AddSingleton
Singleton lifetime services are created the first time they are requested (or when ConfigureServices is run if you specify an instance there) and then every subsequent request will use the same instance.
