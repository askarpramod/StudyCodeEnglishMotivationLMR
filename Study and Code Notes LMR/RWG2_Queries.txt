Harmony Yoga’s approach to teaching yoga is unique: It is non-dogmatic, egalitarian, and student based.  In all Harmony Yoga classes you can expect uniformly well rounded, creative, quality classes instructed in a nurturing, non-competitive, and safe environment that welcomes absolutely everyone. You will grow physically stronger and become more flexible than you imagined possible while simultaneously finding a sense of calm and inner peace that comes with routine Harmony Yoga practice. Harmony Yoga opened its doors in 1999.  Independently owned and operated by Najla Barile, Harmony Yoga is one of the oldest yoga studios in the South Bay and a community hub for the practice of yoga and mindfulness.  Najla is deeply rooted both in the South Bay and in the small business tradition.  Her grandfather opened the first dry cleaning business in the South Bay in 1905 picking up and delivering people’s clothes with a horse and buggy.  This grew into a family franchise that remains in her family to this day.  Najla keenly understands the role of a small business in making a community feel more like extended family.  Students describe feeling like they are “coming home” every time they enter the studio.\n\nHarmony Yoga teachers are passionate about yoga and its many benefits.  They continually educate themselves through self-study and by attending workshops and trainings with master teachers from all over the world.  All Harmony Yoga teachers are Yoga Alliance Certified, and in keeping with the tradition of community building, many are graduates of the Harmony Yoga Teacher Training program.  Some have been with the studio since it opened.","website":"http://www.harmonyyoga.com","cancellationPolicy":"","refundPolicy":"","locale":"en-US","hasLiabilityWaiver":true,"imageURLs":[{"size":"Mobile","url":"https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/studios/HarmonyYoga26/logo_mobile.png?imageversion=351"},{"size":"Banner","url":"https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/studios/HarmonyYoga26/logo.gif?imageversion=351"}],"creditCardTypesAccepted":["Visa","MasterCard","Discover","AmericanExpress"],"id":26,"name":"Harmony Yoga"},"contactInfo":{"phone":"3103796905","streetAddress":"901 North Pacific Coast Highway","city":"redondo beach ","stateCode":"CA","postalCode":"90277","countryCode":"US","longitude":-118.3906534,"latitude":33.8548811},"distance":null,"id":533114,"name":"Harmony Yoga - Redondo Beach","olsonTimeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},{"description":"W.

Hot House Yoga has been opened since 2005 with our first studio in Virginia Beach.  Our extensive schedule makes finding time to practice easy for everyone, beginners and advanced students alike. The studios have been designed with convenience and comfort in mind. As soon as you walk through the doors you realize how easy it is to be a member at Hot House. The facility offers “swipe card “ check in, private showers, towel service, storage, and changing areas for your convenience. The retail area is there to supply you with all your yoga apparel and accessories. Sky ceilings and cork floors help set the mood, allowing one to escape from the stresses of everyday life. Hot House is committed to making your yoga experience unforgettable.\n\nThe teachers and staff share in the same philosophy that the Yax family grew up with, providing an open and hospitable environment for students to feel comfortable and welcome. Of the seven children in the family, five teach at Hot House, and it was by no chance that they were introduced to Yoga. Their parents met at the Phildelphia Academy of Arts, and in 1972 moved the family to Virginia Beach. Their mother and father had interests in the Association for Research and Enlightenment, A Course in Miracles, meditation, gardening, healthy living, and painting. Their friends were local artists, musicians, teachers, gardeners, vegetarians, and free thinkers … pioneers of holistic living. The family sheltered friends that needed a place to stay even though the house was already full. Their father introduced them to the power of prayer, intention, meditation, healthy eating, and their mother to the power of loving your family. “Our family has always been teaching… teaching us how to take care of each other.” It was a natural step that teaching yoga became a means for the Yax family to continue to have a place that they offer others to come and feel welcome. \n\nThe door is always open at Hot House Yoga.

Focus is placed on multi-sensory stimulation to enhance brain development in infants, toddlers and young children. Classes aim to assist parents in attachment and bonding.  A large emphasis is placed on creating an environment where parents can learn how to identify and read the children’s cues, interact, and participate in exercises and activities that they can continue at home to encourage learning and development.  The OTB program was formed with the philosophy of strengthening the bond between parent and child, while stimulating the brain through learning in mind.  We are committed to teaching parents ways to teach their children, so that future learning is easier and more accessible.  Activities that incorporate visual and audio tracking, internal rhythm setting, thought progression, right-brain/left-brain manipulation, fine motor skills, mimicking, overall brain stimulation, and the use of specifically chosen learning tools are used.  Children are encouraged to use their voices, interact with other members, share, take turns, explore boundaries, experience through child-directed play activities, and explore new concepts.  Because children learn by repetition, some of the class content stays the same for adaptation, however, new learning activities and thinking concepts are introduced every week as well as hands-on, heavy sensory activities.

Taking a class is more about self-discovery than any kind of ego. As long as you’re attempting to see what your body can do and challenging yourself, you’re practicing yoga. It’s not about what the person next to you is doing, but about knowing what’s going on inside of your body and mind.\r\n\r\nHere we’ll teach you different ways to breathe, how to strengthen your back and the right way to push yourself. Yoga is both an exercise and a therapy. It balances your muscles and lengthens your spine so that energy can run freely through your body.

In order to cancel or reschedule a personal training appointment, you must contact your trainer at least 24 hours in advance of the scheduled appointment or you will be charged for that session. (NOTE: any exception to this policy will be made purely at the discretion of the trainer.) Similarly, if a trainer does not contact you at least 24 hours in advance to cancel or reschedule an appointment, you will receive a complimentary session.<br/>Bean-Town Bootcamp's 4-week program or Season Pass costs are not refundable. Refund only available if client cancels entire program with at least 5 days notice before program start date. If you do cancel with at least 5 days notice, a $40 administration fee will be deducted from your refund. After the start date of the program no refunds are available and missed sessions from one 4-week bootcamp program cannot be carried over as credit towards another future 4-week program. TARDINESS All clients and trainers are encouraged to be prompt. Late arrival to a session can be not only disruptive to fellow clients, but it is also extremely unsafe. Careful steps are taken to ensure that participants are warmed up safely. Skipping proper warm-up can result in injury. For Personal Training, if a client arrives late, this time will be deducted from the session; contrarily, if a trainer arrives late, the amount of time will be added for an extended session. Please be advised that trainers are required to wait 15 minutes for a scheduled client, after which time the session is subject to cancellation and clients will be charged for a full session. All Bootcamp and Personal training participants are encouraged to be prompt. If you arrive more than 5 minutes late, you will not be allowed to participate in class. This rule is strictly enforced as it is in both your interest as well as the other participants. &nbsp;Weather or Natural Disaster Cancellations: Beantown Bootcamp and our other fitness programs are all weather outdoor fitness programs. Most conditions will not stop us from canceling class. A winter snow advisory or snow emergency might cause us to cancel class. A hurricane, severe humidity /air quality advisory, tornado warning and/or severe thunder storm /lightening storm or any natural disaster may cause us to cancel a class or cease a class already in progress. Every attempt by beantown bootcamp to schedule a make up class will be attempted. However if a particular class or classes in one 4-week session cannot be made up in that same 4 week period no refund will be provided nor will a class or classes be allowed to be carried over as credit to another 4-week session. If you have a class pass and have reserved space in a particular class you will not be charged as attended if a natural disaster causes class cancellation.&nbsp;</div>","refundPolicy":"<div>PAYMENTS, REFUNDS AND CREDITS Payments must be made in full prior to the start of each program.

Memberships are designed to allow for 1 vacation week per season.<br/>Every 3 month period has 13 weeks, but we only bill our members for 12 of them (4 weeks per month). Typically between holidays and vacations there is one week each season that kids cannot make it in for training, which is why we don&rsquo;t charge for that extra week.</p>\r\n<p>Since sports families have such varying schedules, we stay open for all 13 weeks. If your child can make all 13 then that last week is our gift to you for being so committed to your training.</p>\r\n<p>2. We hope you will complete every session you sign up for.</p>\r\n<p>We work very hard to ensure you can reschedule ahead of time when you need to. Reschedules can be done through the mind body system.</p>\r\n<p>Part of our job is to teach our athletes to ingrain the habits of responsibility and dependability, and making scheduled sessions is a part of that process.</p>\r\n<p>3. All rescheduling requires a minimum of 12 hours notice.</p>\r\n<p>With small groups that have limited space, this is a necessity. Giving notice allows us to coordinate what is best for everyone, staff properly, and allow those who requested your space but were denied a chance to fill your spot.</p>\r\n<p>4. Those who give less than 12 hours notice or fail to show up for their session CANNOT make up that class&hellip;.after the first time.</p>\r\n<p>If you request a class and take up one of the limited spaces in that class, it is yours whether you show up or not. That said, we understand that occasionally emergencies do come up at the last minute and we do allow for one emergency make up session every 3 months.</p>\r\n<p>5. Exceptions to this policy are made on extreme weather days.<br/>Severe weather can present an unnecessary risk for travel, and on such days if you feel the weather would create dangerous conditions for you please call or email us as early as possible to reschedule.

Cancellation Rules for Unlimited Classes: You may cancel a class 12 hours or more before the scheduled class. If you are able to reach someone at the gym by telephone (307) 655-5891 and cancel your class, your cancellation window is 5 hours. Leaving a message, sending a text or email is NOT considered reaching someone. If you do not cancel within your window and have signed up for future classes, your reservation for the next class will be removed and your name will be moved to the bottom of the wait list. We aren&rsquo;t trying to punish you; we are just trying to make it fair for everyone that wants to attend a class. Call us and cancel in your window and you will keep your future reservations.

Not only is it an excellent tool to train football players, it is a great functional exercise machine for anyone who wants to strengthen their core. \r\n\r\nThe Woodway Curve is a completely non-motorized treadmill that allows users to accelerate and decelerate at their own speed. Because the user is powering the machine they are able to burn 30% more calories than on traditional machines. If the Woodway Curve looks familiar it might be because you have seen it used on The Biggest Loser. \r\n\r\nAnother piece of equipment seen on The Biggest Loser is the Jacobs Ladder. It is uniquely angled so that it takes the stress off the lower back and knees. The 12” step allows for complete range of motion. This low impact, high range of motion machine delivers a superior core and cardio workout for elite athletes and anyone interested in increasing their strength and endurance. The weighted vest adds resistance to any exercise to maximize the results.\r\n\r\nThe Kinesis Technogym is the best functional trainer on the market. It offers over 400 zero impact exercises that follow your natural range of motion. Whether you are trying to perfect your batting or golf swing, or want to improve your range of motion after an injury, the Kinesis helps build balance, flexibility and strength. Unlike many workout facilities that charge extra fees to use the Kinesis, EFS offers the machine to all its members for free.\r\n\r\nThis is an ideal machine for both beginners and elite athletes who want to perform a range of core and isolated muscle exercises. Whether you just want to get stronger and leaner, or you want to strengthen the muscles used by tennis players, golfers, baseball players and swimmers, this machine will help you achieve your goals.\r\n\r\nThe Hammer Strength weight lifting program is used to train Olympic athletes around the world. \r\n\r\nThe Sorinex Rack was custom made for high intensity sit ups and pull ups.\r\n\r\nExercise balls and stability discs increase core strength, stability and flexibility. \r\n\r\nKettlebell workouts are highly effective and yield amazing results. They are great for losing weight, gaining muscle and building strength. \r\n\r\nResistance cords are attached to the legs and arms so that your muscles react with more power to handle the load. When the cords come off you produce more power than ever running, kicking and throwing. \r\n\r\nAgility and speed are crucial for any dominant athlete. These agility tools help you move, change direction and position your body quickly and effectively. They also help you learn how to explosively start and stop. \r\n\r\nWhether you are a football player or simply want to develop strength and power in the legs and core, the Prowler is an excellent exerciser\r\n","ratings":{"total":5,"average":5.00},"subscriber":{"description":"Whether you want to lose weight, become an elite athlete, or simply want to be able to take out the garbage without throwing your back out, Enhance Fitness Studio can help you achieve your personal fitness goals","website":"http://www.enhancefitnessstudio.com","cancellationPolicy":"","refundPolicy":"","locale":"en-US","hasLiabilityWaiver":true,"imageURLs":[{"size":"Mobile","url":"https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/studios/EnhanceFitnessStudio/logo_mobile.png?imageversion=65"},{"size":"Banner","url":"https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/studios/EnhanceFitnessStudio/logo.gif?imageversion=65"}],"creditCardTypesAccepted":["Visa","MasterCard","Discover","AmericanExpress"],"id":25780,"name":"I Noah Training"},"contactInfo":{"phone":"7088374348","streetAddress":"6475 Joliet Road A1000","city":"Countryside","stateCode":"IL","postalCode":"60525","countryCode":"US","longitude":-87.883847599999967,"latitude":41.772179},"distance":null,"id":1429250,"name":"I Noah Training","olsonTimeZone":"America/Chicago"},{"description":null,"ratings":{"total":0,"average":0.00},"subscriber":{"description":null,"website":"http://aimfitnessma.com","cancellationPolicy":"","refundPolicy":"","locale":"en-US","hasLiabilityWaiver":false,"imageURLs":[{"size":"Mobile","url":"https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/studios/FitnessAddictionMA/logo_mobile.png?imageversion=17"},{"size":"Banner","url":"https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/studios/FitnessAddictionMA/logo.gif?imageversion=17"}],"creditCardTypesAccepted":["Visa","MasterCard","Discover","AmericanExpress"],"id":25790,"name":"AIM Fitness"},"contactInfo":{"phone":"9786979488","streetAddress":"589 Chickering Road","city":"North Andover","stateCode":"MA","postalCode":"01845","countryCode":"US","longitude":-71.117618100000016,"latitude":42.6967452},"distance":null,"id":1429251,"name":"AIM Fitness","olsonTimeZone":"America/New_York"},{"description":null,"ratings":{"total":7,"average":5.00},"subscriber":{"description":"TaiChi - Meditation - Qigong - Traditional Dance Classes - Workshops - Private Sessions","website":"http://jadelady.com","cancellationPolicy":"<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div id=\"glance_gesture\" class=\"glance_no_pointer_events\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div id=\"glance_agent_cursor\" class=\"glance_hide\">&nbsp;</div>","refundPolicy":"<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div id=\"glance_gesture\" class=\"glance_no_pointer_events\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div id=\"glance_agent_cursor\" class=\"glance_hide\">&nbsp;</div>","locale":"en-US","hasLiabilityWaiver":true,"imageURLs":[{"size":"Mobile","url":"https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/studios/JadeLadyMeditation/logo_mobile.png?imageversion=150"},{"size":"Banner","url":"https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/studios/JadeLadyMeditation/logo.gif?imageversion=150"}],"creditCardTypesAccepted":["Visa","MasterCard","Discover","AmericanExpress"],"id":25833,"name":"Jade Lady Meditation"},"contactInfo":{"phone":"9075622863","streetAddress":"508 West 2nd Avenue, Suite 103 (facing E Street)","city":"Anchorage","stateCode":"AK","postalCode":"99501","countryCode":"US","longitude":-149.89169755253585,"latitude":61.220148136869355},"distance":null,"id":1430130,"name":"Jade Lady Meditation","olsonTimeZone":"America/Anchorage"},{"description":"On the corner of Dike Rd and Tuscawilla, right in front of First Baptist Church of Tuscawilla.","ratings":{"total":0,"average":0.00},"subscriber":{"description":"30 minute fitness boot camp consisting of flexibility, mobility, cardio and strength exercises.
